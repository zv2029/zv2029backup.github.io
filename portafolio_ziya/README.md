## Portfolio Documentation

For my portfolio, I strived to create a space that embodies both my creative spirit and professional aspirations. The projects page exemplifies this balance through its thoughtful design choices and interactive elements.

The layout features three carefully curated projects aligned horizontally, each presented in a rectangular format that maintains clean lines and professional presentation. I chose to frame these projects against a white background, complementing the minimalist black and white color scheme that runs throughout the site

However, I wanted to infuse personality into this structured presentation. Therefore, I incorporated:
Dynamic hover effects on project cards that respond to user interaction without disrupting the clean aesthetic
Descriptive text that appears below each project, maintaining the Montserrat font family for typographic consistency
An interactive background with floating words like "write," "create," and "innovation" that speaks to my dual passion for literature and technology

Each element was carefully chosen to create a cohesive presentation that remains true to my aesthetic values while maintaining professional polish. The floating text in the background serves as a subtle reminder of the creative spirit that drives my work. I want the user to be able to almost float throughout the site, with an almost calming yet professional look.
